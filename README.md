Simple CLI to clean some obvious things in terraform files


# Install

_This tool is not (yet) available as binary release. Until that has been picked up, you can install this tool as follows:_

```
go install github.com/tiesmaster/tfcleanup@latest
```

NOTE: This does require a recent version of golang, but this should be fairly easy to aquire. For OSX, do the following:

```
brew install golang
```
